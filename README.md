# Image-Denoising
An image had been denoised by using wavelet transform
Developed an image denoising project in Python, leveraging matplotlib and scikit-image for processing and visualization.
Achieved a highest PSNR of 27.66 dB with VisuShrink, demonstrating superior noise reduction capabilities.
Analyzed and compared denoising algorithms using PSNR, and applied effective signal processing and thresholding techniques.
